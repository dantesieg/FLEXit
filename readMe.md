## FLEXit

A simple, open source tweak for opening [FLEX](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX) via [Activator](https://github.com/rpetrich/libactivator) gesture. This tweak is better than [FLEXing](https://github.com/NSExceptional/FLEXing) because of the setup proccess for the developer, and the dependency on libobjcipc

To compile:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ipadkid358/FLEXit.git
cd FLEXit
./setup.sh
make
```
